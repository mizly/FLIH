# fly_gym repo cleanup plan (for FLYNN paper release)

Produced by reading the FLYNN paper (`root (1).tex`) in full and auditing every tracked file plus
the large gitignored data/output directories against it, with an adversarial second pass on every
removal/relocation candidate (see "verify" evidence — nothing below is a first-guess).

**Nothing has been deleted, moved, or committed except the one specific consolidation logged below.**
Everything else in this document is still a plan to review, not an executed action.

---

## Progress log

- **Merged `connectomes/ws_small_world/add_weight.py` into `generate_ws_network_new.py` and deleted
  `add_weight.py`.** Investigation found a *second*, previously-unaudited generator script,
  `connectomes/ws_small_world/generate_ws_network_new.py`, sitting alongside the original
  `generate_ws_network.py`. File mtimes show `generate_ws_network_new.py` (not the older file) is
  what actually produced the currently-active SmallWorldNet data: it adds the missing Step 10
  (`assign_neuron_types`) that generates `consolidated_cell_types.csv` — something the older script
  never did — and its output schema matches what's on disk exactly. However, it still only wrote a
  2-column edge list (`pre_root_id,post_root_id`), while the real, in-use
  `connections_ws_small_world.csv` has a 3rd `syn_count` column. A separate, standalone,
  **unseeded** one-off script, `add_weight.py` (`df["syn_count"] = np.random.uniform(0, 1,
  size=len(df))`, no `np.random.seed(...)` call, not imported/called by anything), was the missing
  piece — its own mtime and the edge-list file's mtime lined up to the minute, confirming it ran as
  a manual post-process step right after generation.
  **Fix applied**: `generate_ws_network_new.py`'s `generate_ws_graph()` now assigns
  `syn_count = np.random.uniform(0.0, 1.0, size=len(ws_edges))` and writes all 3 columns in one pass,
  before the DN/community/matching steps run — so it draws from the same `RANDOM_SEED=42`-seeded
  global RNG stream as the rest of the script instead of a second, unseeded process. `add_weight.py`
  was then deleted (it was untracked, unreferenced, and fully superseded by this merge).
  **This supersedes §1.5 and the `generate_ws_network.py` references in §2b/§2c below** — see the
  updated §1.5 for what's fixed and what (the missing `connectome/` input subdirectory) is still open.

- **Fixed `generate_ws_network_new.py`'s `CONNECTOME_DIR` to point at
  `connectomes/drosophila adult connectome/` directly** (was `SCRIPT_DIR/"connectome"`, a
  subdirectory that never existed). Verified by importing the module and running Step 1
  (`load_fly_connectome()`) standalone against the real data: it now loads successfully —
  5,342,446 edges, 138,603 nodes, DN=1,303, HB_L=37, HB_R=40, JO=222, Vis_L=2,208, Vis_R=2,310
  (matches the paper's stated connectome stats). **Did not run the full script** (Steps 3–10 involve
  Watts-Strogatz generation + Louvain + up to 500 greedy-matching restarts over a 138k-node graph —
  slow, and it would overwrite the `connections_ws_small_world.csv`/`descending_neurons.csv`/modality
  CSVs your current SmallWorldNet checkpoints and `eval_data/` were produced against). **Caveat**:
  because the `syn_count` draw (added in the merge above) now happens inside `generate_ws_graph()`,
  a future full run will consume the seeded RNG stream in a different order than before Step 4
  onward — so re-running this script will be deterministic *from now on*, but will not reproduce
  today's exact DN sample / community assignment bit-for-bit (nothing that was previously exactly
  reproducible is lost by this, since the old split add_weight.py step was unseeded anyway). §1.5 is
  now resolved as a code-correctness issue; whether/when to actually trigger a full regeneration run
  is your call.

- **§1.1 resolved: `shared_config.py` now defaults to FLYNN.** `BASE_PATH` is now
  `"connectomes/drosophila adult connectome/"` (was `"connectomes/ws_small_world/"`), with a comment
  explaining to comment out the FLYNN line and uncomment the SmallWorldNet line to switch. `EDGE_PATH`
  no longer needs a second, independently-toggled comment/uncomment pair (the old pattern that could
  drift out of sync with `BASE_PATH`) — it's now derived from `BASE_PATH` via a small
  `_EDGE_FILE_BY_BASE_PATH` lookup, so there's exactly one line to toggle. Verified by import:
  `BASE_PATH`/`EDGE_PATH`/`CELL_TYPES_CSV` all resolve to real, existing FLYNN files by default.

- **§1.2 resolved: `train_connectome_rnn_dagger.py` hyperparameters now match the paper.** Changed
  `N_DAGGER_ITERS` 2→4, `EPISODES_PER_ITER` 700→500, `TRAIN_STEPS_PER_ITER` 500→300,
  `GRAD_ACCUM_STEPS` 4→2 (effective batch 64×2=128), `BETA_START` 0.0→1.0, `START_NOISE` 0.0→0.5,
  `NOISE_DECAY` 0.0→0.2, and `RESUME_CHECKPOINT_PATH` `"checkpoints/connectome_rnn_dagger_princeton_2.pt"`→`None`
  (train from scratch). Verified by import: all values now match the paper's stated schedule exactly
  (4 iters / 500 episodes / 300 steps / effective batch 128 / beta 1.0→0 at −0.5/iter / noise 0.5→0
  at −0.2/iter / from-scratch).

- **§1.3 resolved: added a `texture_mode` selector to `MuJoCoTwoCamEnv`, defaulting to checkerboard.**
  Restored `environment/mujoco_model_random_obstacles.xml` (the tracked file) to its checkerboard
  content (undoing the uncommitted PNG-texture edit) and moved the photo-realistic PNG-texture content
  into a new sibling file, `environment/mujoco_model_random_obstacles_realistic.xml`. Deleted the
  now-redundant `environment/mujoco_model_random_obstacles_checker.xml` snapshot (its content lives
  back in the main file). `MuJoCoTwoCamEnv.__init__` gained a `texture_mode` parameter
  (`"checker"` default, `"realistic"` alternative) with a `TEXTURE_XML_BY_MODE` class-level lookup
  and a `ValueError` on unknown values; all existing call sites (`train_connectome_rnn_dagger.py`,
  `run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py`, `train_visionnet_dagger.py`, `run_vision_agent_checkpoint.py`,
  `train_connectome_rnn_rl.py`, `run_critic_warmup.py`, `test_vfhplus.py`, `tune_direction_threshold.py`)
  construct the env with keyword args only, so none needed changes to keep working with the new default.
  Verified by actually instantiating the env with both `texture_mode="checker"` and `"realistic"` (both
  reset and render successfully) and confirming the default and the `ValueError` on a bogus mode.
  **Not done** (wasn't asked): wiring an actual OOD-eval call site to pass `texture_mode="realistic"` —
  right now that's still whatever the person running the OOD eval does by hand; happy to add that if
  wanted.

- **§1.4 mostly resolved: fixed the broken root-level checkerboard bar charts.** Investigating turned
  up a bigger root cause than originally scoped: `eval_data/` currently contains only fresh
  timestamped rollout folders (`connectome_rnn_20260305-171657`, `vision_efficientnet_20260306-120518`,
  etc.) — **neither** of `collision_statistics.py`'s two hardcoded folder lists (the commented-out
  16-folder checkerboard sweep, or the "active" 4-folder OOD sweep) resolves to anything that exists
  on disk anymore. So the original recommendation ("uncomment the checkerboard list and re-run it")
  would not have worked — it would have just skipped every folder and produced an empty result,
  because the raw per-episode data behind *both* figure sets has since been deleted/rotated away, not
  just the checkerboard one.
  What was still recoverable without any new evaluation: `collision_statistics_checker_texture.csv`
  (16-row aggregate, already sitting in the repo, values match the paper's Table I almost exactly)
  still has the mean/std numbers needed for 5 of the 6 bar charts, and
  `performance_results/checker_texure/` already had correctly-rendered SPL distribution plots. So:
    - Backed up the current (OOD-condition) root `bar_*.png` + `spl_*.png` to a new
      `performance_results/textured_env/` folder before touching anything (nothing lost).
    - Refactored `collision_statistics.py`: extracted the grouped-bar-chart code into a new
      `plot_grouped_bars(out_df, output_dir=None)` function (previously inlined and nested under an
      `if spl_data:` guard it didn't actually need), and added `regenerate_bars_from_stats_csv(csv_path,
      output_dir=None)`, which loads an aggregate CSV directly and calls it — for exactly this
      "the raw eval_data is gone but the aggregate CSV survived" situation.
    - Added a defensive guard in `__main__`: if none of the configured folders exist under
      `eval_data/`, skip `collision_statistics()` entirely (print a warning) instead of silently
      overwriting `collision_statistics.csv` with an empty result — this exact class of bug is what
      broke the bar charts in the first place, so it can't quietly happen again.
    - Ran it: `bar_collisions.png`, `bar_success_rate.png`, `bar_average_spl.png`,
      `bar_average_spl_success.png`, `bar_average_speed.png` regenerated correctly at the repo root
      (verified: `collision_statistics.csv`, the OOD data, stayed byte-identical throughout; visually
      confirmed `bar_success_rate.png` now shows all 4 models with values matching Table I, e.g. total
      blindness FLYNN 44%/EfficientNet 4%/MobileNet 17%/SmallWorldNet 3% vs. the paper's 44.3/3.9/16.5/2.6).
      Also copied `spl_violin_plots.png`, `spl_histograms.png`, `spl_accumulated_histograms.png` from
      `performance_results/checker_texure/` to the root (visually confirmed `spl_histograms.png` is
      the correct 4-panel, one-per-vision-condition figure).
    - **`bar_time_to_goal.png` could not be fixed this way** and was left untouched (still shows the
      OOD condition, backed up alongside the others) — `collision_statistics_checker_texture.csv` has
      no "Time to Goal Mean/Std" columns (it predates that feature), and the raw `steps`/`goal_reached`
      per-episode data needed to compute episode duration for the checkerboard sweep no longer exists
      anywhere on disk. **This needs your input**: the only way to get a correct checkerboard-condition
      `bar_time_to_goal.png` (and, more generally, fully fresh/complete data for everything) is to
      re-run the evaluation sweep (`run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py` for FLYNN/SmallWorldNet,
      `run_vision_agent_checkpoint.py` for EfficientNet/MobileNet, 4 vision conditions each) against
      the checkpoints in `checkpoints/`, which is a real compute commitment (hundreds of episodes ×
      16 configs) I didn't want to kick off unilaterally. **Decision (per author): leave
      `bar_time_to_goal.png` as a documented gap for now** — not fixing until/unless a fresh
      evaluation sweep happens for other reasons.

- **§1.6 resolved: `run_vision_agent_checkpoint.py`'s `checkpoint` is now a required CLI argument.**
  Added `argparse`: `checkpoint` is a required positional arg (previously
  `checkpoint_path = os.path.join(CHECKPOINT_DIR, "efficientnet_dagger_final_robust.pt")` with a
  silent "if missing, grab whatever *.pt happens to be in checkpoints/ first" fallback — exactly the
  kind of implicit choice that made it impossible to tell from the code alone which checkpoint
  produced a given result). A missing/nonexistent path is now a loud `FileNotFoundError` listing the
  actual available checkpoints, not a silent substitution. `model_type` is now auto-detected from the
  checkpoint filename via the existing `_detect_model_type()` helper (previously a separately
  hardcoded `model_type = "efficientnet"` constant that had to be kept in sync by hand — a second,
  related footgun: passing a MobileNet checkpoint while this stayed "efficientnet" would corrupt or
  crash the load). Added an optional `--model-type` override for filenames auto-detection would guess
  wrong on. Verified: `--help` shows both; running with no checkpoint arg fails fast with argparse's
  usage error; running with a bad path raises `FileNotFoundError` listing real checkpoints; running
  with a real MobileNet checkpoint auto-detects `model_type=mobilenet` and starts evaluating
  correctly; running with an intentionally mismatched `--model-type` against a real checkpoint fails
  loudly with PyTorch's `load_state_dict` shape-mismatch error instead of silently loading garbage
  weights. `episodes`/`vision`/`render`/internal-state-recording config were left as the existing
  hardcoded constants in `main()` — only the checkpoint-selection ambiguity was in scope here.

- **§1.7 resolved: fixed `tune_direction_threshold.py`, including a second bug beyond the one
  originally flagged.** The stale `rollout_episode` import (removed when
  `train_connectome_rnn_dagger.py` was refactored to the batched, multi-env
  `rollout_and_collect_balanced()`, which has a fundamentally different interface — it fills a
  shared buffer across N envs rather than returning one episode's raw trajectory, so it's not a
  drop-in replacement) is now a small local `rollout_episode()` reimplemented directly in
  `tune_direction_threshold.py`, covering only the pure-teacher-drive case
  (`beta=1.0, beta_noise=0.0`) this script actually calls with — it raises `NotImplementedError` for
  any other beta, rather than silently pretending to support agent-blended rollout it doesn't
  implement. While tracing the call path, also found `cell, pr_positions, input_splits =
  build_connectome_cell(...)` unpacking only 3 values from a function that now returns 4 (the exact
  same bug class already found and removed in `train_connectome_rnn_rl.py`/`run_critic_warmup.py`) —
  fixed to unpack all 4. Verified by actually running the script end-to-end (not just import-checking
  it): it built the real FLYNN connectome cell (138,584 nodes, now the default per §1.1), ran a
  225-step teacher-only episode, and regenerated `direction_tuning_plot.png` with a sane-looking
  result (a turn spike at the start settling to near-zero angle change once the path straightens out).

- **§1's fixes were committed** to a new branch, `cleanup-for-publication` (PR opened against `main`),
  covering exactly: `shared_config.py`, `train_connectome_rnn_dagger.py`,
  `environment/mujoco_two_cam_env_random_obstacles.py`, both `environment/mujoco_model_random_obstacles*.xml`
  files, `collision_statistics.py`, `run_vision_agent_checkpoint.py`, `tune_direction_threshold.py`, and
  this file. **Left out on purpose** (per author decision): `analysis_pca_statistics.py`,
  `compare_trajectories.py`, `count_collisions.py`, `run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py`,
  `visualize_episodes.py`, and `code update log.txt` — all still uncommitted, in-progress personal
  analysis-script edits unrelated to the §1 fixes. This matters for §2 below: it means those 5 scripts'
  *current on-disk state* is not what got cleaned up, even though §2a previously described them as
  settled.

- **Audited §2 for accuracy after the above.** Independently re-verified every claim in §2 (existence
  checks, `git check-ignore -v` for every §2b path, repo-wide grep for every §2d/§2e "zero
  references"/"genuinely wired in" claim, file-size spot checks, and direct reads of current file
  content) rather than trusting the original write-up. Found and fixed 4 real discrepancies:
    - **§2a was stale for the 5 uncommitted files listed above.** Their current content isn't the
      "keep as-is, reproduction-ready" state §2a described — concretely, `analysis_pca_statistics.py`
      crashes immediately on its own `assert os.path.isdir(folder)` if run today (its
      `CONDITION_FOLDERS` point at `eval_data/small_world_*_states` paths that no longer exist);
      `visualize_episodes.py` and `count_collisions.py` both target `eval_data/*_textured_env` folders
      that don't exist either; `run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py` now defaults `CHECKPOINT` to a
      SmallWorldNet checkpoint instead of FLYNN — directly contradicting §1.1 — and has a live
      `cv2.imshow` debug preview wired into its render path; `compare_trajectories.py`'s `BASE_DIR` is a
      hardcoded personal absolute path outside the repo. Moved these 5 out of §2a into a new
      "2a-caveat" table (see below) rather than silently leaving §2a wrong.
    - **§2c misnamed a file**: the claim that `analysis_pca.py` *and* `visualize_episodes.py` already
      point at the external `Publications/IROS2026/materials/` archive was half wrong —
      `visualize_episodes.py` has never referenced that archive (checked both its committed and current
      uncommitted content); `compare_trajectories.py` is the one that actually does. Fixed.
    - **§2c had a stale checkpoint count**: "16 files" in `checkpoints/` → actually 15. Fixed.
    - **§2d had a stale backup-folder count**: "10 dated snapshot folders" in `backups/` → actually 12
      (the 299MB size claim was exactly right). Fixed.
  Everything else in §2 — file existence, `.gitignore` exclusion behavior for every §2b path, size
  claims in §2c, and "zero references"/"genuinely wired in" claims throughout §2d/§2e — held up under
  independent verification.

- **§3 applied: rewrote `.gitignore`**, but not verbatim as originally drafted — verifying it against
  `git check-ignore -v` (as the original §3 note already warned to do) turned up a real ordering bug in
  my own proposed rewrite before it went in:
    - **Bug found**: the draft put the connectome-CSV exceptions (`!connectomes/**/JO-C_and_JO-E.csv`
      etc.) *before* the later blanket `*.csv` rule for root result files. Gitignore resolves
      overlapping patterns by last-match-wins, so that later blanket `*.csv` was silently re-ignoring
      every connectome CSV exception that came before it — none of the §2b connectome CSVs would
      actually have surfaced as trackable. **Fix**: moved the "Result figures" `*.csv`/`*.png` block
      before the "Connectome data" block, so the connectome-specific exceptions are always the
      last-matching (winning) rule for paths under `connectomes/`.
    - **Also restored `*.pdf`/`*.jpg`**, which the original §3 draft had silently dropped from the old
      `.gitignore` with no documented reason to remove them. Nothing on disk currently needs them
      (confirmed via a repo-wide search — the only `.pdf`/`.jpg`/`.mat`/`.xlsx`/`.gt`/`.gml` files
      anywhere live entirely inside `connectomes/c.elegans connectome/`, already covered by that
      folder's own blanket ignore), but keeping them costs nothing and avoids a silent regression in
      protection for future stray files.
    - **Verified with `git status --short --untracked-files=all` + spot-check `git check-ignore -v`**
      after the fix: exactly the §2b file set now surfaces as untracked (7 small connectome CSVs ×2
      folders, `generate_ws_network_new.py`, 4 `environment/textures/*.png`, 6 `bar_*.png`, 3
      `spl_*.png`, `collision_statistics.csv`, `collision_statistics_checker_texture.csv` — 31 files
      total) — and nothing else. Confirmed everything meant to *stay* ignored actually does:
      `connections_princeton.csv` (261MB, §2c external-hosting), `generate_ws_network.py` (superseded,
      §2d), `performance_results/checker_texure/`'s and `performance_results/textured_env/`'s `bar_*.png`
      backup copies (would otherwise have matched `!bar_*.png` if `performance_results/` weren't
      separately folder-ignored — gitignore can't re-include a file whose parent directory is itself
      ignored, which is exactly why that folder rule is load-bearing here), and the 3 superseded
      `collision_statistics*.csv` duplicates.
    - **One unplanned side effect, not in the original §2b list**: `connectomes/drosophila adult
      connectome/data source.txt` also now surfaces as untracked — it's a `.txt` file, so it was never
      covered by the old blanket `connectomes/` folder-ignore's replacement (the new rules only touch
      `*.csv`/`*.py` inside `connectomes/`, plus the two named unrelated-dataset folders). This is the
      file §2c already cites for provenance ("gives provenance but no license"), so surfacing it seems
      like a good thing, not a leak — but flagging it since it wasn't a deliberate §2b entry.
  **Not done yet** (this was scoped to the `.gitignore` rewrite itself): `git add`-ing the newly-visible
  files and committing — that's §4 step 3, a separate step.

- **§2b executed: staged all 30 newly-un-ignored files** (`git add`, not yet committed). Verified with
  `git status --short` immediately after: all 30 show as `A` (staged-new), and the only file left
  untracked is the one deliberately-excluded extra from §3's Progress log entry,
  `connectomes/drosophila adult connectome/data source.txt` (not a §2b item — still an open question,
  not added). Total size of the staged set: **10.9MB**, measured per-file with `du` over
  `git diff --cached --name-only` (corrected — the "6.9MB" first reported here was wrong, caused by a
  `du -ch` invocation over multiple explicit paths silently mis-summing once a space-containing path
  was in the mix; re-verified file-by-file this time). Either way: small, no surprise large files
  snuck in via a wildcard mistake (every path was added explicitly, not via glob). **Not committed** —
  staged only, pending your go-ahead to fold into a commit (either a new commit on
  `cleanup-for-publication`, or its own branch/PR).

- **§2d executed**, split by reversibility:
    - **Tracked files, `git rm`'d** (reversible via git history): `models/connectome_rnn_model_no custom
      autograd.py`, `MUJOCO_LOG.TXT`, `train_connectome_rnn_rl.py`, `run_critic_warmup.py`.
    - **Fixed the resulting dangling import** in `run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py`: removed
      `from train_connectome_rnn_rl import CTRL_PENALTY, TIME_PENALTY, PROG_SCALE, GOAL_BONUS,
      CONTACT_PENALTY` and inlined the 3 values it actually uses as local constants
      (`CTRL_PENALTY=0.001`, `TIME_PENALTY=0.01`, `PROG_SCALE=10.0` — copied verbatim from the deleted
      file); `GOAL_BONUS`/`CONTACT_PENALTY` were dead imports (`_make_env()` already hardcodes
      `goal_bonus=0, contact_penalty=0` directly), so they were dropped rather than inlined. Verified:
      a repo-wide grep confirms this was the only live dependent (a second reference exists only inside
      `backups/`, already a separate concern); `ast.parse` confirms the file still parses; tracing where
      these 3 constants flow showed they only ever feed an RL-style `reward`/`"return"` column that gets
      summed and written to each episode's raw summary row but is never actually consumed by
      `collision_statistics.py`/Table I — so inlining them is behavior-preserving, not just
      syntax-preserving. This edit was scoped to exactly this one import; none of
      `run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py`'s other pre-existing uncommitted scratch edits (§2a-caveat)
      were touched.
    - **Also fixed** a now-stale docstring line in `shared_config.py` ("Used by both
      `train_connectome_rnn_dagger.py` and `train_connectome_rnn_rl.py`" → just the former). Verified
      the module still imports correctly.
    - **Removed** the empty `tests/` directory (confirmed empty via `ls`, and untracked — git doesn't
      track empty dirs — so this was a plain `rmdir`, nothing lost).
    - **Everything else in §2d is untracked, disk-only data with no git backup**, so deleting it
      outright isn't reversible the way the `git rm`s above are. Rather than `rm` it, moved all of it
      into a new holding folder, `_pending_deletion/` (added to `.gitignore` so it doesn't pollute
      `git status`), preserving relative paths:
      `connectomes/ws_small_world/generate_ws_network.py`, `connectomes/drosophila adult
      connectome/{parquet_to_csv.py, Connectivity_783.csv, Connectivity_783.parquet.png,
      connections_princeton_random.csv, photoreceptors_pos_{left,right}.csv, moonwalker_neurons.csv,
      olfactory_ORN_DM1_{left,right}.csv}`, `connectomes/c.elegans connectome/`, `connectomes/drosophila
      larva connectome/`, most of `loss/` (see correction below), and the 3 superseded
      `collision_statistics*.csv` variants. Total: **525MB** (measured with `du -sh` over the actual
      holding folder — bigger than §2d's own original per-item size estimates suggested, mainly because
      `Connectivity_783.csv` turned out to be 239MB, not the few-MB figure implied by "reformat of the
      same data" framing). Nothing was permanently deleted — this is a plain local move, fully
      reversible by moving files back out.
    - **Correction found while moving `loss/`, caught before anything was lost**: it contains a
      `loss/keep/` subfolder (3 PNGs: `connectome princetion.png`, `full_model.png`,
      `random_connectome.png`) that had clearly already been hand-curated and named "keep" — direct
      evidence these specific plots were deliberately preserved, contradicting §2d's blanket
      classification of all of `loss/` as safe to remove. **`loss/keep/` was restored to `loss/keep/`
      immediately, not moved into `_pending_deletion/`**; only the rest of `loss/` (the per-model
      `*_dagger_loss.csv` files and 5 non-"keep" `losses_*.png` plots) went into the holding folder. A
      follow-up repo-wide search for other "keep"-named paths turned up two more, both left untouched:
      `checkpoints/keep/` (currently empty — doesn't resolve §2c's still-open "which checkpoints to
      host" question, but hints you'd started curating one) and
      `backups/20251223_teacher_mlp/checkpoints/keep` (inside `backups/`, already a separate, deferred
      concern). Neither was in the original plan; flagging both here.
  **Not done** (out of scope, per §2d's own recommendation): archiving or removing `backups/` — still
  needs an external storage destination decided first.

- **§2a-caveat: `run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py` fixed, moved back into §2a.** Three targeted fixes,
  layered on top of the file's pre-existing scratch state without disturbing the rest of it:
    - **Checkpoint path is now a required CLI positional argument** (`argparse`, matching §1.6's fix to
      `run_vision_agent_checkpoint.py`), replacing the hardcoded `CHECKPOINT =
      "checkpoints/connectome_rnn_dagger_small_world_full_vision.pt"` module constant that was silently
      defaulting to SmallWorldNet and directly contradicting §1.1. No fallback default — the existing
      `FileNotFoundError` in `_load_agent()` already covers a bad/missing path, so nothing new was added
      there. Verified: `--help` shows the arg and its rationale; no args → argparse usage error, exit 2;
      a nonexistent path → the existing `FileNotFoundError` fires (after env construction, same as
      before — unrelated to this fix).
    - **Fixed the `cv2` bug**: `import cv2` was a hard import, but `maybe_show_cameras()` guarded on
      `if cv2 is None: return` — dead code, since a failed hard import raises `ImportError` at module
      load instead of leaving `cv2` as `None`. Changed to `try: import cv2 / except ImportError: cv2 =
      None`, so the debug camera-preview window degrades gracefully to a no-op on a machine without
      `opencv-python`, matching what the guard clause always implied it should do.
    - **Uncommented the 3 disabled vision conditions** in `__main__` (`dir2`/`dir3`/`dir4`: right-eye-only,
      left-eye-only, blind) so all 4 conditions run again, matching the paper's full ablation sweep,
      instead of just the one (full-vision) condition that was left active.
    - **Verified by actually running it**, not just syntax-checking: a smoke test (not committed — ad hoc,
      outside the repo) called `_load_agent`/`_make_env`/`rollout_episode` directly against a real FLYNN
      checkpoint (`connectome_rnn_dagger_princeton_full_vision.pt`) for all 4 vision masks headlessly.
      Built the real 138,584-node connectome cell and ran successfully end-to-end: full vision and
      right-eye-only both reached the goal (366 and 355 steps); left-eye-only and blind both timed out
      at the 600-step cap without reaching it — directionally consistent with the paper's finding that
      vision loss hurts navigation. Confirmed `cv2` imports normally (soft-import is a no-op when the
      package is actually present). No debris left in the repo — the smoke test wrote to a system temp
      directory, not `eval_data/`. **Not committed** — this fix sits on top of the file's other
      pre-existing uncommitted scratch edits (wrong `save_hidden_states` flag, etc.), same situation as
      before; only the 3 requested changes were made, nothing else in the file was touched.

- **§2a-caveat: `analysis_pca_statistics.py` and `count_collisions.py` accepted as resolved (author
  call), moved back into §2a.**
    - `analysis_pca_statistics.py` was edited manually (outside this session): every `CONDITION_FOLDERS`
      entry's hardcoded personal absolute path
      (`D:\Benquan\OneDrive MSState\...\fly_gym\eval_data\...`) was replaced with a generic
      `path_to\eval_data\...` placeholder — removing the machine-specific path the earlier audit flagged.
      Confirmed via `git diff` that this is the only substantive change (plus unrelated tweaks to
      `COLORS`/`N_PCS`). The live `assert os.path.isdir(folder)` will still fire until `path_to` is
      substituted with a real path — that's expected for a template, not a leftover bug, so this is
      accepted as resolved as-is rather than something needing a working default path.
    - `count_collisions.py`: accepted as-is, no changes made. Its active `__main__` folder list still
      points at `eval_data/*_textured_env` folders that don't exist yet — per author, this reflects an
      in-progress/future experiment naming rather than a defect, so it's no longer treated as an open
      problem.

- **§2a-caveat: `visualize_episodes.py` partially fixed** (docstring added, debug filter removed;
  `target_dir` issue still open). Added a module-level docstring describing what the script does
  (reads `trajectory_<episode>.csv`/`obstacles_<episode>.txt` pairs plus `episode_summary.csv` goal
  positions, saves one `visualization_<episode>.png` per episode). Removed the hardcoded
  `if ep_id is not 26: continue` debug filter that limited every run to a single episode (also fixing
  the `is not`-on-an-int anti-pattern by deleting it, rather than correcting it to `!=`). Verified by
  actually running the underlying logic against a real eval_data folder with real trajectory data
  (`eval_data/connectome_rnn_20260306-084812/`, 75 episodes) rather than just syntax-checking: all 75
  episodes were processed and plotted (min=1, max=75), confirming the filter no longer silently
  restricts output to episode 26. Output was written to a scratch directory, not `eval_data/`, and
  cleaned up afterward — no debris left in the repo. **Not touched** (out of scope for this request):
  `target_dir = "eval_data/small_world_textured_env"` still points at a folder that doesn't exist —
  the file remains in the 2a-caveat table for that reason alone.

- **`visualize_episodes.py` marked done (author call), moved into §2a.** No further changes made — the
  remaining `target_dir` gap is accepted as-is, same reasoning as `count_collisions.py` just above
  (reflects an in-progress/future experiment, not a defect). The 2a-caveat table now holds only
  `compare_trajectories.py`.

- **`compare_trajectories.py` edited manually (outside this session), marked complete.** Confirmed via
  `git diff` that `BASE_DIR`'s hardcoded personal absolute path
  (`D:\Benquan\OneDrive MSState\...\Publications\IROS2026\materials\trajectories\small_world`) was
  replaced with a generic `path_to\trajectories` placeholder — same fix pattern already accepted for
  `analysis_pca_statistics.py`. Other changes in the diff (`FOLDER_LABELS` reordering/relabeling "Blind"
  → "Total Blindness", one extra `COLORS` entry) are cosmetic, unrelated to the reproducibility concern.
  **§2a-caveat is now empty** — all 5 files originally flagged there are resolved or accepted as-is;
  every file in §2's "keep as-is" role now lives in the single §2a table.

- **§2e row 1 resolved (author decision: drop).** Deleted `test_verification_data/obstacles_1.txt`
  (tracked — `git rm`'d, recoverable from git history if ever needed) and its untracked siblings
  `trajectory_1.csv`/`activity_1.csv` (plain `rm` — no git history existed for these, so this is not
  recoverable through git). The directory was left empty afterward and removed.

- **§2e row 2 resolved (author decision: drop).** Deleted `agents/dual_backbone_agent.py` (`git rm`)
  and removed every trace of its two dependents rather than just deleting-and-hoping:
    - `run_vision_agent_checkpoint.py`: removed the `DualBackboneAgent` import, the
      `preprocess_obs_cpu_dual()` function, every `is_dual` branch inside `run_episode()` (pinned-buffer
      allocation, CPU preprocessing dispatch, CPU→GPU transfer for both the CUDA and non-CUDA paths),
      the `dual_mobilenet`/`dual_efficientnet` cases from `_detect_model_type()` and `_build_agent()`,
      and the corresponding `--model-type` CLI choices/module docstring mention.
    - `train_visionnet_dagger.py`: removed the same import, the `"dual_efficientnet"`/`"dual_mobilenet"`
      entries from `AGENT_REGISTRY`, the `preprocess_obs_cpu_dual()` function, every `is_dual` branch in
      `rollout_and_collect_balanced()` (pinned-buffer allocation, per-env fill, GPU transfer for both
      CUDA and non-CUDA paths, `xs_gpu` dict construction) and in `apply_camera_dropout()` (simplified
      to the single `'img'`-key layout only, with its docstring updated to match), and a now-dead
      `if "backbone_type" in agent_cfg:` kwarg branch in the agent-construction code (only ever
      triggered by the now-removed registry entries).
    - Confirmed via `grep` across every tracked `.py` file (and a repo-wide search excluding
      `backups/`) that zero references to `dual_backbone`/`DualBackboneAgent` remain anywhere live.
    - Verified by actually running the simplified code, not just syntax-checking it:
      `run_vision_agent_checkpoint.py`'s `run_episode()` completed a real 50-step episode against a
      real MobileNet checkpoint; `train_visionnet_dagger.py`'s `apply_camera_dropout()` ran correctly
      against a synthetic batch; `rollout_and_collect_balanced()` ran a real 2-episode, 2-env collection
      pass on this machine's actual CUDA device (confirmed `get_device()` returns `"cuda"` here, so this
      exercised the CUDA pinned-memory transfer path, not just the CPU fallback) and produced sane
      chunk counts (49 straight / 2 turn / 2 start, 0 collision — no crashes, no stray files left in the
      repo afterward).

- **§2e row 3 resolved (author decision: drop).** Deleted `scripts/create_random_connectome.py`
  (tracked — `git rm`'d) and removed the now-empty `scripts/` directory. Permanently deleted its output,
  `connectomes/drosophila adult connectome/connections_princeton_random.csv` (276MB) — this had been
  sitting in the `_pending_deletion/` holding folder since §2d's untracked-data pass; this is the first
  time anything has actually been removed from that folder for good rather than just moved there.
  Cleaned up the two dangling commented-out references to the now-deleted CSV path
  (`shared_config.py`, `run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py`) as a direct consequence of the deletion —
  left the `connectome_rnn_dagger_princeton_random_full_vision.pt` checkpoint reference comment in
  `run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py` untouched, since that trained checkpoint is a separate artifact not
  covered by this request. Verified: both edited files still parse and `shared_config` still imports
  correctly (`BASE_PATH`/`EDGE_PATH` unaffected); repo-wide `grep` (excluding `backups/`) confirms zero
  remaining references to `create_random_connectome`/`connections_princeton_random`.

- **§2e row 4 resolved (author decision: move).** Moved `tune_direction_threshold.py` and
  `debug_rnn_grad.py` into a new `tests/` directory via `git mv` (preserves file history rather than a
  delete-and-recreate). Confirmed neither script is imported/referenced from anywhere else in the repo
  first (`grep`, clean). `tune_direction_threshold.py` imports repo-root modules with no package prefix
  (`from train_connectome_rnn_dagger import ...`) — moving it broke that import
  (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'train_connectome_rnn_dagger'`, confirmed by actually running
  it from the new location before fixing anything). Fixed with
  `sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))` right before the
  import, which resolves the repo root from the file's own location regardless of the caller's working
  directory (more robust than `debug_rnn_grad.py`'s existing `sys.path.append(os.getcwd())` pattern,
  which depends on being invoked with the repo root as cwd — left that file's approach alone since it
  already works and wasn't broken by the move). Verified by actually running both from their new
  location: `debug_rnn_grad.py` passed both its sparse-gradient and agent-loop-simulation checks
  unchanged; `tune_direction_threshold.py` built the real 138,584-node FLYNN connectome cell, ran a
  246-step episode, and regenerated `direction_tuning_plot.png` successfully. Confirmed the output plot
  still saves to wherever the script is *run from* (a plain relative path, not `__file__`-relative), so
  this move doesn't change §2e row 5's still-open question about that file's own location.

- **§2e row 5 resolved (author decision: keep).** Added a `!direction_tuning_plot.png` exception to
  `.gitignore` (same pattern already used for `bar_*.png`/`spl_*.png` in §2b) and staged the file.
  Verified with `git check-ignore`/`git add`/`git status` that it's now trackable. Left its actual
  location alone (still saves to wherever `tests/tune_direction_threshold.py` is run from) — only its
  git-tracked status changed, not where it lives.

- **§2e's last row resolved: wrote `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `requirements.txt`.** Asked before picking a
  license (a real legal decision, not something to infer) — you chose MIT. Derived `requirements.txt`
  entirely from actually grepping every tracked `.py` file's `import`/`from` statements (including
  function-local imports like `analysis_pca_statistics.py`'s deferred `import seaborn`), not from
  memory or assumption — found `torch`, `torchvision`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`,
  `mujoco`, `gymnasium`, `glfw`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `networkx`, and
  `python-louvain` (imported as `community`), each pinned to this dev machine's actually-installed
  version. `README.md` covers repo structure, setup, the still-unhosted data/checkpoint situation
  (§2c), and usage for every training/eval/analysis script. The citation's author list/venue are a
  best-effort guess (venue inferred from the `Publications/IROS2026/` path already referenced
  elsewhere in the repo; author from git config/email) — **explicitly flagged with an inline TODO** in
  the file rather than presented as confirmed fact, since I have no reliable source for the exact
  author list.
  **Found along the way, not previously classified anywhere in §2**: `analysis_pca.py` — a real,
  tracked, distinct script from `analysis_pca_statistics.py` (does basic PCA trajectory visualization
  from saved hidden-state `.npy` files, rather than the KDE/vector-arithmetic analysis). It has the
  same hardcoded-personal-path issue already fixed elsewhere (`NPY_DIR` points at
  `D:\Benquan\...\Publications\IROS2026\materials\PCA\connectome2`). This was already visible in §2c's
  external-archive mention but never given its own §2 row — flagging here rather than silently folding
  it into README's file listing without disclosure. Not fixed or reclassified in this pass (out of
  scope for "write README/LICENSE/requirements.txt"); worth a follow-up decision like the other
  path-placeholder files.

---

## 0. TL;DR

- Only **32 files are currently tracked in git**. Everything else (299MB `backups/`, 1.4GB
  `checkpoints/`, 960MB `connectomes/`, 83GB `eval_data/`, `loss/`, and every stray `*.png`/`*.csv`)
  is excluded by `.gitignore` — some of that correctly, some of it **by accident** (see §1).
- I found **several correctness/reproducibility problems that are bigger than "cleanup"** — things
  that would make a fresh clone silently fail to reproduce the paper's numbers. Fix these *before*
  worrying about which files to delete. See §1.
- Everything else sorts into 4 buckets: keep-as-is, keep-but-fix-`.gitignore`, too-big-for-git
  (external host), and safe-to-remove. A handful of items are a genuine author call, not something
  I can decide from the code alone — flagged as "needs your decision" throughout.

---

## 1. Fix these before (or during) cleanup — real correctness risks, not just tidiness

1. ~~`shared_config.py:26-27` defaults to SmallWorldNet, not FLYNN.~~ **RESOLVED** — see Progress log.
   `BASE_PATH` now defaults to `"connectomes/drosophila adult connectome/"` (FLYNN), with a comment
   explaining how to switch to SmallWorldNet, and `EDGE_PATH` is derived from `BASE_PATH` so the two
   can't drift out of sync the way the old independent-comment-pair pattern could.

2. ~~`train_connectome_rnn_dagger.py`'s hyperparameters don't match the paper's stated schedule.~~
   **RESOLVED** — see Progress log. `N_DAGGER_ITERS=4`, `EPISODES_PER_ITER=500`,
   `TRAIN_STEPS_PER_ITER=300`, effective batch 128, `BETA_START=1.0`/`BETA_DECAY=0.5`,
   `START_NOISE=0.5`/`NOISE_DECAY=0.2`, `RESUME_CHECKPOINT_PATH=None` (from scratch) — all now match
   the paper's stated schedule exactly, verified by import.

3. ~~The two example MuJoCo scene files are mid-swap with no code to select between them.~~
   **RESOLVED** — see Progress log. `environment/mujoco_model_random_obstacles.xml` is restored to
   the checkerboard variant (the default); the photo-realistic PNG-texture variant now lives in its
   own file, `environment/mujoco_model_random_obstacles_realistic.xml`; and
   `MuJoCoTwoCamEnv(texture_mode=...)` selects between them (`"checker"` default, `"realistic"`
   alternative), verified by instantiating both. The now-redundant untracked
   `mujoco_model_random_obstacles_checker.xml` snapshot was deleted.

4. ~~The main bar-chart figures at the repo root look broken for the checkerboard condition.~~
   **MOSTLY RESOLVED** — see Progress log for the full story, including a root cause bigger than
   originally scoped: **neither** folder list in `collision_statistics.py`'s `__main__` resolves to
   anything in `eval_data/` anymore (it now only holds fresh timestamped run folders, e.g.
   `connectome_rnn_20260305-171657`, not condition-named ones) — the OOD list I originally thought
   was "still active/valid" is equally stale. Fixed by regenerating 5 of the 6 root bar charts plus
   all 3 SPL distribution plots directly from the already-correct, already-computed
   `collision_statistics_checker_texture.csv` / `performance_results/checker_texure/` (no raw
   eval_data needed), and added a defensive guard so `collision_statistics.py` can no longer silently
   overwrite a good CSV with an empty one when its configured folders don't exist. **Not resolved**:
   `bar_time_to_goal.png` — the checkerboard aggregate CSV has no "Time to Goal" columns (predates
   that feature), and the raw per-episode duration data needed to compute it no longer exists on
   disk. Fixing that needs a fresh evaluation run; see the question at the end of the Progress log
   entry.

5. ~~`connectomes/ws_small_world/generate_ws_network_new.py` doesn't reproduce its own output file~~
   **RESOLVED.** The real generator (supersedes the older `generate_ws_network.py`, which never
   produced `consolidated_cell_types.csv` at all and isn't what generated the current data) now
   writes the full 3-column edge list in one seeded pass (weight-column merge, see Progress log) and
   `CONNECTOME_DIR` now points at `connectomes/drosophila adult connectome/` directly instead of a
   nonexistent `connectome/` subfolder. Verified Step 1 (`load_fly_connectome`) runs standalone
   against the real data (see Progress log for the exact numbers). The full script (Steps 3–10) has
   not been run — it's slow (WS graph + Louvain + up to 500 matching restarts over 138k nodes) and
   would overwrite the currently-in-use SmallWorldNet data files, so that's left for you to trigger
   when you're ready to accept a freshly-regenerated (not bit-identical) SmallWorldNet instance.

6. ~~`run_vision_agent_checkpoint.py`'s default checkpoint name doesn't match the training script's own
   naming convention~~ **RESOLVED (the ambiguity, not the "which checkpoint was Table I" question)**
   — see Progress log. `checkpoint` is now a required CLI positional argument (no more hardcoded
   default + silent "pick any checkpoint found" fallback), so every future run states explicitly which
   checkpoint it's evaluating instead of leaving that implicit/guessable. You'll still need to decide
   for yourself which checkpoint file was actually used to produce Table I's reported numbers — this
   change just stops the script from hiding or silently substituting that choice going forward.

7. ~~`tune_direction_threshold.py` has a stale import~~ **RESOLVED** — see Progress log. Also found and
   fixed a second, same-class bug in the same file (a stale 3-value unpack of
   `build_connectome_cell()`, which now returns 4). Verified by actually running the script.

None of the above are things I'm fixing myself — they're substantive judgment calls or require
re-running training/eval, so they're yours to make. I mention them here because several of the
file-classification calls below only make sense once you know about them.

## 2. File classification

### 2a. Keep as-is — tracked, correct, needed to reproduce the paper

| File | Maps to |
|---|---|
| `core/astar.py`, `core/utils.py`, `core/vfhplus.py`, `core/__init__.py` | env global path-planning / shared utils+connectome loader / VFH* teacher |
| `environment/__init__.py`, `environment/mujoco_two_cam_env_random_obstacles.py` | MuJoCo env; now has a `texture_mode` selector (`"checker"` default / `"realistic"` for OOD) — §1.3 resolved |
| `environment/mujoco_model_random_obstacles.xml`, `environment/mujoco_model_random_obstacles_realistic.xml` | The two scene variants the selector above picks between (checkerboard training default / photo-realistic OOD) |
| `agents/__init__.py`, `connectome_rnn_agent.py`, `efficientnet_agent.py`, `mobilenet_agent.py`, `teacher_analytic_agent.py` | FLYNN sensory front-end / CNN baselines / DAgger teacher |
| `models/__init__.py`, `connectome_rnn_model.py`, `teacher_analytic_model.py` | FLYNN's core RNN cell + custom sparse autograd / teacher's path-follow controller |
| `train_connectome_rnn_dagger.py` | FLYNN/SmallWorldNet DAgger training (hyperparameters now match the paper — §1.2 resolved) |
| `train_visionnet_dagger.py` | EfficientNet/MobileNet DAgger + camera-dropout training (matches paper exactly) |
| `run_vision_agent_checkpoint.py` | eval rollouts → `eval_data/`, Table I source (checkpoint-CLI fix — §1.6 resolved, committed) |
| `run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py` | eval rollouts across all 4 vision conditions → `eval_data/`, Table I source (checkpoint-CLI fix, `cv2` soft-import fix, all 4 vision conditions uncommented — see Progress log; moved here from 2a-caveat, not yet committed) |
| `shared_config.py` | shared paths/hyperparameters (now defaults to FLYNN — §1.1 resolved) |
| `test_vfhplus.py` | sanity-check tool for the VFH*+PID teacher, worth keeping even with 0 importers |
| `collision_statistics.py` | Table I metrics + root-level bar-chart figures (§1.4 resolved, committed) |
| `analysis_pca_statistics.py` | the actual KDE + `BF≈BL+BR` vector-arithmetic analysis in the paper. `CONDITION_FOLDERS` now uses a generic `path_to\eval_data\...` placeholder template instead of a hardcoded personal absolute path — accepted as resolved by author (see Progress log); running it still requires substituting a real path (the `assert os.path.isdir(folder)` will fire otherwise), which is expected/by-design for a template, not a bug. |
| `count_collisions.py` | Table I collision-count augmentation. Active folder list in `__main__` points at `eval_data/*_textured_env` folders that don't exist yet — accepted as-is by author (see Progress log): reflects an in-progress/future experiment naming, not a defect to fix. |
| `visualize_episodes.py` | Per-episode trajectory plots. Debug filter removed and docstring added (see Progress log); `target_dir` still points at a not-yet-existing `eval_data/small_world_textured_env` folder, but accepted as-is by author for the same reason as `count_collisions.py` above — reflects an in-progress/future experiment, not a defect. |
| `compare_trajectories.py` | The PCA/KDE trajectory-comparison figures. `BASE_DIR` now uses a generic `path_to\trajectories` placeholder template instead of a hardcoded personal absolute path — accepted as resolved by author (see Progress log), same reasoning as `analysis_pca_statistics.py` above. |

**2a-caveat is now empty** — all 5 files originally flagged there (`run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py`,
`analysis_pca_statistics.py`, `count_collisions.py`, `visualize_episodes.py`, `compare_trajectories.py`)
have been resolved or accepted as-is and folded back into the table above; see the Progress log for the
full history of each.

### 2b. Needed, was wrongly excluded by `.gitignore` — **FIXED, staged (not yet committed)**

`.gitignore` now carries explicit `!`-exceptions for every path below (§3), and all 30 files are
currently `git add`-staged (§3/§2b Progress log entries) — verified via `git status --short` to be
exactly this set, nothing more. Still needs an actual commit (your call on branch/PR).

| Path | Size | Why it's needed |
|---|---|---|
| `environment/textures/{ground,wall,obstacle,skybox}.png` | 3.4MB total | Sim assets for the now-separate `mujoco_model_random_obstacles_realistic.xml` (§1.3 resolved), not result figures — was caught by the old blanket `*.png` rule. |
| `connectomes/.../JO-C_and_JO-E.csv`, `consolidated_cell_types.csv`, `descending_neurons.csv`, `head_bristles_{left,right}.csv`, `visual_column_L1_L2_L3_rear_view_{left,right}.csv` (both the adult-connectome and ws_small_world copies, 14 files) | 6.1MB total, largest single file 3.7MB (`consolidated_cell_types.csv`, adult connectome) | Small per-modality neuron ID CSVs the model actually loads (wind/tactile/vision/motor/cell-type). Was caught by the old blanket `connectomes/`+`*.csv` rules. |
| `connectomes/ws_small_world/generate_ws_network_new.py` | 40KB | The actual SmallWorldNet generator (paper §III-C-2) — was sitting inert inside a fully-gitignored folder. Both the weight-column gap and the input-path bug are now fixed (see Progress log / §1.5) — Step 1 verified to run against the real data. |
| `bar_average_speed.png`, `bar_average_spl.png`, `bar_average_spl_success.png`, `bar_collisions.png`, `bar_success_rate.png`, `bar_time_to_goal.png`, `spl_accumulated_histograms.png`, `spl_histograms.png`, `spl_violin_plots.png` | 1.7MB total | The actual paper bar-chart/SPL figures — was caught by the old blanket `*.png` rule. Regenerated per §1.4 (5 of 6 bar charts + all 3 SPL plots now genuinely reflect the checkerboard condition; `bar_time_to_goal.png` remains the one documented gap from §1.4). |
| `collision_statistics.csv`, `collision_statistics_checker_texture.csv` | 4KB each | The literal numeric source of Table I — was caught by the old blanket `*.csv` rule. |

Total staged: **10.9MB** across 30 files (measured per-file with `du`, not the earlier progress-log
estimate of "6.9MB" — that number was wrong, an artifact of a shell quoting issue in the verification
command with a space-containing path; corrected here and in the Progress log).

Not part of this set (a decision still open, not a §2b item): `connectomes/drosophila adult
connectome/data source.txt`, which also now surfaces as untracked as a side effect of the same
`.gitignore` fix — see §3's Progress log entry.

### 2c. Needed, but too large to commit to git directly — external hosting

| Path | Size | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| `connectomes/drosophila adult connectome/connections_princeton.csv` | 261MB | Zenodo/institutional storage + a small download script. **Check flywire.ai / philshiu/Drosophila_brain_model redistribution terms first** — `data source.txt` gives provenance but no license, so this is a real open question, not just a size problem. |
| `connectomes/ws_small_world/connections_ws_small_world.csv` | 169MB | Now fully regeneratable from `generate_ws_network_new.py` (§1.5 resolved) instead of needing external hosting — it's synthetic data with a fixed seed, no license issue. A fresh run won't be bit-identical to the current file (see Progress log caveat), so decide whether to keep the current file as an archived/pinned version or regenerate and treat the new run as canonical. |
| `checkpoints/*.pt` (final models only — see below) | 1.4GB total | Zenodo/HuggingFace/institutional storage + download script, so Table I is reproducible without a full retrain. |

For `checkpoints/`, not all 15 files are equally necessary — recommend hosting only:
`connectome_rnn_dagger_iter_4.pt` (or whichever is FLYNN's final), `connectome_rnn_dagger_princeton*.pt`
(confirm which one is "the" FLYNN checkpoint used for Table I), `connectome_rnn_dagger_small_world_full_vision.pt`,
`efficientnet_dagger_final_{full_vision,robust}.pt`, `mobilenet_dagger_final_{full_vision,robust}.pt`.
The `iter_1..3.pt` intermediates, the `princeton`/`princeton_2`/`princeton_3` resume-chain files, and
`connectome_rnn_dagger_princeton_bad_blind.pt` look like intermediate/discarded runs, not final models
— your call whether any of those need to be archived for provenance.

`eval_data/` (83GB, 1675 files) is the raw per-episode rollout log behind `collision_statistics.py`'s
aggregates. It's regeneratable (re-run the eval scripts against the hosted checkpoints), and I found
that the specific data behind the PCA/KDE/trajectory figures is *already* separately archived outside
both git and `eval_data/` (an external `Publications/IROS2026/materials/` folder `analysis_pca.py`
and `compare_trajectories.py` already point at). Recommend: don't try to publish 83GB; just make sure
that external archive is complete, and let `collision_statistics.csv`/`collision_statistics_checker_texture.csv`
(§2b) be the citable aggregate.

### 2d. Safe to remove — confirmed dead, superseded, or unrelated to the paper — **EXECUTED**

Every row below has been acted on (see Progress log for the full account, including a correction —
`loss/keep/` — caught mid-cleanup). Tracked files were `git rm`'d (reversible via git history, not yet
committed); untracked disk-only data was moved into a new `_pending_deletion/` holding folder rather
than deleted outright, since nothing backs it up. `backups/` is the one deliberate exception — still
untouched, per its own row's recommendation.

| Path | Why | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `models/connectome_rnn_model_no custom autograd.py` | Unreferenced pre-optimization snapshot of `connectome_rnn_model.py` (predates the custom sparse-autograd backward pass); non-importable filename (has a literal space) confirms it was never meant to be loaded. | `git rm`'d |
| `connectomes/ws_small_world/generate_ws_network.py` (the older, non-`_new` file) | Superseded by `generate_ws_network_new.py`: mtimes show the `_new` version is what actually produced the current SmallWorldNet data, and only it generates `consolidated_cell_types.csv` (the older file never did, at all). Keeping both invites a reader to run the wrong one. | Untracked — moved to `_pending_deletion/` |
| `train_connectome_rnn_rl.py`, `run_critic_warmup.py` | Abandoned PPO/critic training path for the connectome RNN. Not mentioned anywhere in the paper (only DAgger is described). Both were broken as committed (`build_connectome_cell()` unpacking mismatch — 3 vs. 4 return values). | `git rm`'d; the one live dangling import (`run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py`) fixed by inlining the 3 constants it actually uses |
| `MUJOCO_LOG.TXT` | Auto-generated MuJoCo physics-instability warning log from a past debugging session; slipped past `.gitignore`'s `*.log` rule because it's `*.TXT`. Not source, not read by anything. | `git rm`'d |
| `connectomes/drosophila adult connectome/parquet_to_csv.py`, `Connectivity_783.csv`, `Connectivity_783.parquet.png` | Superseded, numerically incompatible earlier connectome import (different index space, ~15M edges vs. the paper's reported 5,342,445 — not just a reformat of the same data). Nothing reads it. | Untracked — moved to `_pending_deletion/` (`Connectivity_783.csv` alone is 239MB, not a few-MB reformat as the size estimate here implied) |
| ~~`connectomes/drosophila adult connectome/connections_princeton_random.csv`~~ | Fully regeneratable (via `scripts/create_random_connectome.py`, seed=42), 276MB, referenced only by commented-out code. No reason to store/host the generated CSV. | **DELETED (§2e row 3, author decision)** — permanently removed from `_pending_deletion/`, not just moved there anymore. |
| `connectomes/drosophila adult connectome/photoreceptors_pos_{left,right}.csv`, `moonwalker_neurons.csv`, `olfactory_ORN_DM1_{left,right}.csv` | Raw R1-6 photoreceptor / moonwalker / olfactory data explicitly superseded per your own dev log ("Ditched R1-6 input... SOLUTION: ...L1-3 input") and the paper's own stated rationale. Zero live references; incompatible column schema with the current loader anyway. | Untracked — moved to `_pending_deletion/` |
| `connectomes/c.elegans connectome/` (entire folder, ~423KB) | Unrelated dataset; zero references anywhere in any `.py` file, tracked or not; the paper never mentions C. elegans. | Untracked — moved to `_pending_deletion/` |
| `connectomes/drosophila larva connectome/` (entire folder, ~31MB) | Same — unrelated, unreferenced, predates even the unrelated "CNS project" log entries. | Untracked — moved to `_pending_deletion/` |
| `backups/` (12 dated snapshot folders, 299MB) | Ad hoc whole-repo snapshots from Oct 2025–Jan 2026, all superseded by tracked code and predating even the paper-relevant portion of the dev log. **Caveat**: the repo's first git commit is 2026-02-12, *after* every backup folder's date — so git history does *not* actually preserve this period. Recommend archiving privately outside the repo (zip to institutional storage) rather than hard-deleting, purely so you don't lose ~3.5 months of provenance; it should not ship in the public release either way. | **Not touched** — needs an external archive destination decided first, deliberately out of scope here |
| `loss/` **except** `loss/keep/` (409KB total, minus whatever `keep/`'s 3 PNGs weigh) | Pure training-loss byproduct, regenerated fresh on every run, not read by anything, no paper figure is a loss curve. | Untracked — moved to `_pending_deletion/`, **except `loss/keep/`** (`connectome princetion.png`, `full_model.png`, `random_connectome.png`), which turned out to be hand-curated and was restored in place — see Progress log correction. Two more "keep"-named paths exist (`checkpoints/keep/`, currently empty; `backups/20251223_teacher_mlp/checkpoints/keep`) — neither in the original plan, both left untouched. |
| `tests/` (empty dir) | Empty, unreferenced (its one historical occupant, `test_dagger_buffer.py`, tested a since-renamed/removed class and was already deleted intentionally in an earlier commit). | Removed (`rmdir`; was untracked and confirmed empty, nothing lost) |
| `collision_statistics 1.csv`, `collision_statistics_2_old_crnn.csv`, `collision_statistics_real_textured.csv` | Superseded duplicates of `collision_statistics.csv`/`collision_statistics_checker_texture.csv` (identical data, missing later-added columns, or referencing an abandoned checkpoint-selection sweep). | Untracked — moved to `_pending_deletion/` |

### 2e. Needs your decision — I can't resolve these from the code alone

| Path | The question |
|---|---|
| ~~`test_verification_data/obstacles_1.txt` (+ its untracked siblings `trajectory_1.csv`, `activity_1.csv`)~~ | **RESOLVED (dropped).** Deleted all 3 files per author decision (`git rm` for the tracked `obstacles_1.txt`; plain `rm` for the untracked `trajectory_1.csv`/`activity_1.csv`, which had no git history to lose). The now-empty `test_verification_data/` directory was removed too. |
| ~~`agents/dual_backbone_agent.py`~~ | **RESOLVED (dropped) — author decision.** Deleted the file (`git rm`) and removed every dependency on it in its two call sites: `train_visionnet_dagger.py` (the `"dual_efficientnet"`/`"dual_mobilenet"` `AGENT_REGISTRY` entries, the `preprocess_obs_cpu_dual()` function, all `is_dual` branching in `rollout_and_collect_balanced()` and `apply_camera_dropout()`, and a now-dead `backbone_type` kwarg branch) and `run_vision_agent_checkpoint.py` (the `preprocess_obs_cpu_dual()` function, all `is_dual` branching in `run_episode()`, the `dual_efficientnet`/`dual_mobilenet` cases in `_detect_model_type()`/`_build_agent()`, and the corresponding `--model-type` CLI choices). See Progress log for verification detail. |
| ~~`scripts/create_random_connectome.py` (+ its output, already listed for removal in §2d)~~ | **RESOLVED (dropped) — author decision.** Deleted the script (`git rm`; the now-empty `scripts/` directory was removed too) and permanently deleted its output CSV (previously just moved to `_pending_deletion/` during §2d — now actually removed from there). Cleaned up the two dangling commented-out references to the deleted CSV path in `shared_config.py` and `run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py` (left the still-relevant `connectome_rnn_dagger_princeton_random_full_vision.pt` **checkpoint** reference comment alone — that trained checkpoint wasn't part of this request and isn't deleted). Confirmed via `grep` that no `.py` file outside `backups/` references `create_random_connectome`/`connections_princeton_random` anymore. |
| ~~`tune_direction_threshold.py`, `debug_rnn_grad.py`~~ | **RESOLVED (moved) — author decision.** Both moved into a new `tests/` directory (`git mv`, preserving history) — the same `tests/` folder §2d's Progress log removed as empty; this reintroduces it with real content. `tune_direction_threshold.py` imported repo-root modules with no package prefix (`from train_connectome_rnn_dagger import ...`), which broke once it moved out of the repo root (`ModuleNotFoundError`, confirmed by actually running it); fixed with a `sys.path.insert` based on `__file__`'s parent directory, so it resolves the repo root regardless of the caller's cwd. `debug_rnn_grad.py` already had an equivalent `sys.path.append(os.getcwd())` fix from before and needed no changes. Both verified by actually running them from their new location — see Progress log. |
| ~~`direction_tuning_plot.png`~~ | **RESOLVED (kept) — author decision.** Added a `!direction_tuning_plot.png` exception to `.gitignore` (same pattern as §2b's `bar_*.png`/`spl_*.png`) and staged the file. Still saves to wherever `tests/tune_direction_threshold.py` is run from (repo root, in the verified case from §2e row 4) — this only changes whether it's tracked, not where it lives. |
| ~~README.md / LICENSE / `requirements.txt` / citation file~~ | **RESOLVED (written) — author decision: MIT license.** `requirements.txt` lists every third-party package actually imported anywhere in the tracked codebase (verified by grepping every tracked `.py` file for `import`/`from` statements, not guessed from memory), pinned to the versions tested on this dev machine, with a note about installing a CUDA-matched `torch`/`torchvision` build. `LICENSE` is MIT (your choice — asked rather than picked unilaterally, since it's a legal decision with real consequences and interacts with the still-open FlyWire.ai data-terms question in §2c). `README.md` covers the repo structure, setup, the (still-unhosted, see §2c) data/checkpoint situation, and usage for every training/eval/analysis script. Citation section has a placeholder BibTeX (title confirmed from the paper; venue inferred as IROS 2026 from the `Publications/IROS2026/` path referenced elsewhere in the repo; author list is a guess from git config/email — **flagged inline in the file with a TODO to confirm before publishing**, not asserted as fact). |

## 3. `.gitignore` rewrite — **APPLIED**

**Status: done.** (The texture/xml decision this used to be gated on was §1.3, not §2e as an earlier
draft of this heading said — that's resolved too, see Progress log.) Keeps the blanket exclusions for
genuinely-bulk/output directories, but carves out the specific assets/scripts/summaries identified in
§2b. Applied to the actual `.gitignore` and independently verified with `git check-ignore -v` and
`git status --short --untracked-files=all` — see the Progress log entry for the ordering bug that check
caught (a later blanket `*.csv` rule was silently re-ignoring the earlier connectome-CSV exceptions) and
exactly how it was fixed:

```gitignore
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
.venv/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pdf
*.jpg
MUJOCO_LOG.TXT

# Model checkpoints (host externally, see CLEANUP_PLAN.md §2c)
*.pt
*.pth

# Bulk data / generated artifacts
*.parquet
*.jsonl
*.out
backups/
checkpoints/
eval_data/
loss/
performance_results/

# Result figures: ignore stray CSV/PNG dumps, keep the final published ones
*.csv
!collision_statistics.csv
!collision_statistics_checker_texture.csv
*.png
!environment/textures/*.png
!bar_*.png
!spl_*.png
!direction_tuning_plot.png

# Connectome data: ignore big raw edge lists, keep small metadata + scripts.
# This block must come AFTER the generic *.csv rule above -- gitignore resolves
# overlapping patterns by last-match-wins, so if the blanket *.csv rule came last
# it would silently re-ignore the connectome exceptions below.
connectomes/**/*.csv
!connectomes/**/JO-C_and_JO-E.csv
!connectomes/**/consolidated_cell_types.csv
!connectomes/**/descending_neurons.csv
!connectomes/**/head_bristles_*.csv
!connectomes/**/visual_column_L1_L2_L3_rear_view_*.csv
connectomes/**/*.py
!connectomes/ws_small_world/generate_ws_network_new.py
connectomes/c.elegans connectome/
connectomes/drosophila larva connectome/
```

Verified via `git status --short --untracked-files=all` that exactly the 31 files listed in the Progress
log now show up as untracked (ready for `git add`) — the §2b set plus one unplanned but seemingly-benign
extra, `connectomes/drosophila adult connectome/data source.txt` — and that everything meant to stay
ignored (the 261MB `connections_princeton.csv`, the superseded `generate_ws_network.py`, the
`performance_results/*/bar_*.png` backup copies, the 3 superseded `collision_statistics*.csv` duplicates)
still does.

**Not done**: `git add`-ing these newly-visible files and committing them — that's §4 step 3 below, not
yet executed.

---

## 4. Suggested execution order

1. ~~Resolve §1.3 (texture/xml decision) and §1.2 (DAgger hyperparameters) first~~ **Done** — see
   Progress log. Next: decide whether to actually re-run DAgger training with the corrected
   from-scratch hyperparameters (§1.2) and/or wire an OOD-eval call site to pass
   `texture_mode="realistic"` (§1.3), since the code fixes alone don't retrain/re-evaluate anything.
2. ~~Re-run `collision_statistics.py` with the checkerboard folder list (§1.4)~~ **Done** — see
   Progress log (turned out the raw eval_data was gone entirely; fixed by regenerating from the
   surviving aggregate CSV instead). Still open: `bar_time_to_goal.png` needs a fresh eval run to
   fix properly — your call whether/when to do that. `performance_results/checker_texure/` and the
   new `performance_results/textured_env/` backup are both worth keeping as provenance for now
   rather than retiring either.
3. ~~Apply the `.gitignore` rewrite (§3) and `git add` the newly-un-ignored files~~ **Done** — see
   Progress log (including a real ordering bug found and fixed in the `.gitignore` along the way). All
   30 §2b files are staged; `git status` confirms nothing from `checkpoints/`/`eval_data/`/
   `connections_princeton.csv` leaked in. Still open: actually committing the staged files (your call
   on which branch/PR), and deciding on the one extra untracked file this turned up,
   `connectomes/drosophila adult connectome/data source.txt` (not part of §2b, see §3's Progress log
   entry).
4. ~~`git rm` the confirmed-dead tracked files and fix the resulting dangling import~~ **Done** — see
   Progress log/§2d. `models/connectome_rnn_model_no custom autograd.py`, `train_connectome_rnn_rl.py`,
   `run_critic_warmup.py`, `MUJOCO_LOG.TXT` are all `git rm`'d (staged, not committed);
   `run_connectome_rnn_checkpoint.py`'s dangling import was fixed by inlining the 3 constants it
   actually needed.
5. ~~Delete (not git-tracked, just disk cleanup) the confirmed-dead untracked data~~ **Done, but as a
   move rather than a delete** — see Progress log/§2d. All of it (`connectomes/c.elegans connectome/`,
   `connectomes/drosophila larva connectome/`, the listed `drosophila adult connectome/` files, most of
   `loss/`, the 3 superseded `collision_statistics*.csv` variants) now sits in a new `_pending_deletion/`
   holding folder (gitignored) instead of being permanently removed, since none of it is backed by
   git — your call whether/when to actually delete it for good (§2e row 3's `connections_princeton_random.csv`
   has since actually been deleted from this folder for good, not just moved). One correction along the
   way: `loss/keep/` was NOT moved (see §2d) — it turned out to be a deliberately-preserved subfolder,
   not dead data. The empty `tests/` (untracked, confirmed empty) was `rmdir`'d directly rather than
   moved — it has since been recreated with real content (§2e row 4: `tune_direction_threshold.py`,
   `debug_rnn_grad.py`).
6. Archive `backups/` and (post-verification) the bulk of `eval_data/` to external/institutional
   storage rather than deleting outright, then remove from the working copy.
7. Decide whether to trigger a full `generate_ws_network_new.py` run now that §1.5 is fixed (this
   will produce a fresh, valid, but not bit-identical SmallWorldNet dataset — see Progress log), or
   keep the current `connections_ws_small_world.csv` pinned as-is. Either way, upload
   `connections_princeton.csv` and the pruned `checkpoints/` set to external hosting, with a small
   download script + README section pointing at them.
8. Resolve the remaining §2e author calls (`dual_backbone_agent.py` comment, `create_random_connectome.py`
   keep/drop, `tune_direction_threshold.py`/`debug_rnn_grad.py` keep/relocate, `test_verification_data/`
   keep/drop) at your convenience — none of these block a first public push.
9. Write README.md, LICENSE, requirements.txt/environment.yml, and a citation entry.
